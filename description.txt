Colored Damage Types has been abandoned and needs edits to its code in order to work with basic tML features, so I made this.

Complete with presets, customization, and options for how to handle modded damage types for which you haven't added colors.

Mod calls:
AddPreset [Mod] [string (preset internal name)] [Dictionary<string, (Color hitColor, Color critColor)> (default colors)]
AddToPreset [string (preset full internal name, "mod/name")] [string (damage class full name, "mod/name")] [Color (hit color)] [Color (crit color)]
